The island nation is home to these strange meat eaters, who are covered in a symphony of spots and hidden in mystery. Unlike their famous African cousins, Sri Lankan leopards hunt quietly across grasslands and weave through unbreakable jungles, their presence a whisper in the wind, only visible in the twilight."
